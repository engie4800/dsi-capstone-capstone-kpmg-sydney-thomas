1. Domestic Economic Recovery: Domestic economic recovery will support non-oil tax revenues. A pick-up in domestic consumption and broader private sector activity in 2024 will support non-oil tax revenues, partly compensating for relative weakness in oil-related public revenues that reflects lower international oil prices.
2. Fiscal Indicators: A deterioration in fiscal indicators will be mild and of limited concern. The budget is expected to remain in deficit due to continued weakness in international oil prices and is estimated to remain close to the level for 2023. A budget deficit of 1.9 percent of GDP and a public debt stock of 25.9 percent of GDP represent low ratios relative to peers.
3. Government Fiscal Balance Efforts: Government efforts to balance fiscal sustainability and spending on economic reforms will continue. Vision 2030 objectives designed to restructure the economy will remain the thrust of government spending and investment.
4. Key Spending Categories: Key spending categories will remain stable. The 2024 budget indicates that the Health and social development, Defense, Education and Infrastructure and transport categories will remain priority sectors in terms of public spending.
5. External Economic Shocks: External economic shocks remain key risks to fiscal and broader economic policy success. Policy mismanagement and geopolitical tensions could derail ongoing economic recovery.","The fields of section Key Takeaways are Domestic Economic Recovery, Fiscal Indicators, Government Fiscal Balance Efforts, Key Spending Categories, and External Economic Shocks.","The fields of section Key Takeaways are: Domestic Economic Recovery, Fiscal Indicators, Government Fiscal Balance Efforts, Key Spending Categories, and External Economic Shocks.",0.689965606,0.896419883,0.89651227
